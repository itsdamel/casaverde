    <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>
        This project is one of <a href='https://alura-7dayscode.vercel.app/' target='_blank'>ALURA #7DAYSOFCODE</a>'s challenges.<br><br> The goal of this challenge was to:
    </h3>     
    <ul style="text-align: left">
        <li>Create a homepage for an ecommerce.</li><br>
        <li>Use the sendGrid API to send a newsletter confirmation e-mail.</li><br>
        <li>Fetch a url with mock data to dinamically display the plants on the offer section</li><br>
        <li>Use styled components to style de page.</li><br>
        <li>Make a filter so users can manipulate how data is displayed</li>
    </ul>
    
</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
    <h3>
        The additional features I've incorporated into the application was:
    </h3>     
    <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 16px">
        <li>100% responsiveness across all screen sizes, ensuring a seamless user experience. This involved selectively hiding certain elements on smaller screens.</li><br>
        <li> Introduced a complex shopping cart functionality, allowing users to monitor the total price of their purchases, adjust item quantities, and remove items as needed.</li>  <br>
        <li>  Generated mock data using json-server to populate the product offers section during development.</li><br>
        <li> Developed a backend server using Node.js and Express. This server enables both POST requests to interact with the SendGrid API and GET requests to retrieve data from the deployed mock server.</li><br>
        <li> Customized pop-up notifications, such as informing users of invalid email addresses in the newsletter subscription and confirming the addition of items to the shopping cart.</li><br>     
    </ul>

    <h2>Good practices</h2>
    <p>I invested significant effort into organizing the project's folder structure to ensure clarity and maintainability. These Incluse: directory for pages, components, contexts and shared styled components. I also made sure to take full advantage of React's features and utilized the context API to effectively prevent prop drilling.</p>

    <h2>Dev's thoughts</h2>
    <p>This is my second project exclusively dedicated to my portfolio. Compared to my first project, Casa Verde demanded a broader range of knowledge in various technologies. Creating a Node server to fetch my API was incredibly fun! I've surely become better at reading documentation.</p>
    <p>E-commerce projects are very common, and now I understand why, It was an amazing opportunity to showcase and sharpen my skills. Manipulating data here was very similar to what I did on my popular-movies project, but wow! Practice really pays off! I did it so much faster!</p> 
    <p>I've been developing with React for a while now so it wasn't a big challenge, but working with styled components was an entirely new experience for me. I had read about it before but this was my first time coding it myself and uf, what a lifesaver! I thoroughly consulted the official documentation to ensure proper organization.</p>   
    <p>Overall, Casa Verde was a fantastic project from which I've learned a tremendous amount!</p>
    <p>If you've read this far, thank you for your interest and patience! I genuinely hope you have an amazing day :)</p>
