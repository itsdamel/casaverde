    <h2>Features</h2>
    <h3>
        This project is one of <a href='https://alura-7dayscode.vercel.app/' target='_blank'>ALURA #7DAYSOFCODE</a>'s challenges.<br><br> The goal of this challenge was to:
    </h3>     
    <ul style="text-align: left">
        <li>Create a homepage for an ecommerce.</li><br>
        <li>Use the sendGrid API to send a newsletter confirmation e-mail.</li><br>
        <li>Fetch a url with mock data to dinamically display the plants on the offer section</li><br>
        <li>Use styled components to style de page.</li>
    </ul>
    
</div>

<div style="text-align: center">
    <h3>
        The additional features that I've included into the application was:
    </h3>     
    <ul style="text-align: left; font-size: 16px">
        <li> Made the page 100% responsive for all screen sizes. It includes hiding some elements on smaller screens.</li><br>
        <li> Added a whole shopping cart functionality where users could follow the total price of their purchase, manipulate quantity of items or delete them. </li>  <br>
        <li> I myself have created the mock data with json-server used to populate the offer section myself.</li><br>
        <li> Created a back-end server to make post request to sendGrid API with node and ViteExpress</li><br>
        <li> Customized pop ups for user interactions(ex. invalid e-amail on the newsletter, item added to shopping cart)</li><br>
        <li>Final purchase page with React Route</li><br>
        <li></li><br>
        <li></li><br> 
    </ul>

    <h2>Dev's thoughts</h2>
    <p>This is the second project I've done exclusively dedicated to my portfolio. Compared to the first one, casa verde demanded so much more knowledge on diverses technologies, creating a node server to fetch my api was super fun! It definitely made me better at reading documentation. I've seen e-commerce projects everywhere, and now I understand why, I can really flex some skills now, haha. The process of adding items to the shopping cart, deleting them, saving on local storage and such was very similar to what I did on my popular-movies project, but wow! Practice really pays off! I did it so much faster than on my first time XD! I've been using React for a while now so it wasn't a big challenge, but styled components was something tottaly new to me! I've read about it before but it was my first time actually coding it myself and woof, what a life safer! I had to read a lot about how to organize my styled components, I learnt it going through the official documentation. After finishing the project I cameback to refactor pretty much every single styled component in a much more effortless way.  Overall, it was a great project where I've learnt tons from!</p>
    <p>If you've read this far, thank you for your interest and patience! I genuinely hope you have an amazing day :)</p>
